## Shiny

  Today we learned what is shiny and how it works. We used IMDB movie data and we made ggplot with that data while using shiny.
  

```{r}
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
#
# Find out more about building applications with Shiny here:

#

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(
   
   # Application title
   titlePanel("Movie Set"),
   
   # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
   sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
         sliderInput("year",
                     "Movie set from IMDB",
                     min = 2000,
                     max = 2005,
                     value = c(2003,2004)),
         selectInput("genres","genres",c(genres)),
         sliderInput("ratings","ratings",min = 0,max = 158000, value=0)),
         
      
      # Show a plot of the generated distribution
      mainPanel(
         plotOutput("distPlot")
      )
   ))


# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

   output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
     mydata <- shiny_movie_set %>% filter(votes >= input$ratings) %>% filter(year >= input$year)
     ggplot(mydata, aes(x=length, y=rating, color=genre)) +
       geom_point(stat="identity")
    
      # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
     
   })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)




```
